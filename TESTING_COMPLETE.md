**Benefits:**
- Catch regressions early

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests:

**1. Route Test:**
```typescript
test('/new-page loads', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/new-page');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/New Page/);
});
```

**2. CTA Test:**
```typescript
test('New CTA works', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: /new cta/i }).click();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/target');
});
```

**3. Accessibility Test:**
```typescript
test('New page: No a11y violations', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/new-page');
  const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
  expect(results.violations.filter(v => v.impact === 'critical')).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

---

## Debugging Failed Tests

### View Test Results:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Run in UI Mode:
```bash
npm run test:ui
# Interactive mode with time-travel debugging
```

### Run in Debug Mode:
```bash
npm run test:debug
# Step through tests with breakpoints
```

### Screenshot on Failure:
- Automatically saved to `test-results/`
- Shows exact state when test failed
- Helpful for visual regression
