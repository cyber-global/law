## How We Work: 3 Clear Steps

1. **Call** – Connect with breach counsel now.
2. **Stabilize** – Privileged facts, scope, and notifications.
3. **Resolve** – Close out with regulator-ready evidence.

When an incident hits, you don't have time for lengthy onboarding or unclear processes. Our 3-step approach gets you immediate counsel, stabilizes the legal and regulatory situation, and closes out with documentation that stands up to scrutiny.
