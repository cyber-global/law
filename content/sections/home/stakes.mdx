## What's at Stake

### If Mishandled

- **Regulatory fines:** Up to 4% of annual turnover (GDPR) or â‚¬10M+ (NIS2)
- **Litigation exposure:** Class actions, contractual disputes, and D&O claims
- **Business disruption:** Extended downtime while waiting for legal clarity
- **Trust erosion:** Customer churn, partner concerns, and reputational damage
- **Insurance denial:** Coverage disputes due to late notice or inadequate documentation

### If Done Right

- **Faster recovery:** Clear legal guidance accelerates technical remediation
- **Reduced penalties:** Cooperation and proper notification often result in lower fines
- **Audit-ready documentation:** Defensible records for regulators, insurers, and auditors
- **Preserved relationships:** Transparent, calm communications maintain stakeholder trust
- **Insurance recovery:** Proper notice and documentation maximize coverage and reimbursement
