question: Do you handle cross-border SaaS vendors?

**Yes.** Cross-border SaaS contracts are one of our core practice areas.

**Common scenario:**  
You're an EU-based company using a US SaaS provider (or vice versa). You need Data Processing Agreements (DPAs), Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), and Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) to comply with GDPR's restrictions on third-country data transfers.

**What we provide:**

1. **DPAs with practical TOMs (Technical and Organizational Measures):**  
   Annexes that your engineering team can actually implement and verify

2. **SCC selection and customization:**  
   Which modules apply (Controller-to-Processor, Processor-to-Processor)? What annexes are required? What supplementary measures are needed?

3. **Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs):**  
   Post-Schrems II compliance—assessing third-country laws, government access risks, and additional safeguards (encryption, pseudonymization, data minimization)

4. **Vendor negotiations:**  
   We negotiate on your behalf or support your procurement team in vendor discussions

5. **Multi-party scenarios:**  
   Sub-processors, docking clauses, joint controllers, and pass-through obligations (e.g., if you're a SaaS provider with your own customers)

**Jurisdictions we handle:**

- **EU ↔ US:** SCCs, TIAs, adequacy framework discussions (DPF)
- **EU ↔ UK:** UK IDTA (International Data Transfer Agreement) or SCCs
- **EU ↔ Switzerland:** Swiss-specific SCCs
- **EU ↔ Other third countries:** Case-by-case TIA and supplementary measures

**Outcome:**  
Audit-ready vendor contracts that pass customer due diligence, ISO 27001 audits, and DPA scrutiny.
