question: What if we don't have logs?
order: 2

Missing or incomplete logs are one of the most common challenges in incident responseâ€”and one of the biggest risk factors in regulatory investigations.

**Immediate steps if logs are missing:**

1. **Document what you *do* know:** Alerts, user reports, forensic artifacts, external threat intel
2. **Explain the gap:** Did logs not exist, were they overwritten, or were they not retained long enough?
3. **Show remediation:** What are you doing *now* to improve logging and retention?

**Regulatory perspective:**

- **GDPR Article 32** requires "appropriate technical measures" including logging for security monitoring
- **NIS2** mandates security measures including "logging and monitoring"
- Missing logs can be seen as **inadequate security controls**, which may increase penalties

**Our role:**

- We help you document what *can* be reconstructed from available evidence
- We draft regulator notifications that explain gaps without creating additional liability
- We advise on **post-incident remediation** to show regulators you're fixing the root cause

**Proactive fix:**  
Implement centralized logging (SIEM), define retention periods (legal hold + compliance requirements), and test log availability regularly. We help you document retention policies that satisfy legal and regulatory requirements.
