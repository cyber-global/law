question: When do we notify under GDPR/NIS2?
order: 1
---

**GDPR** requires notification to the relevant Data Protection Authority (DPA) **within 72 hours** of becoming aware of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. If the breach poses a **high risk**, you must also notify affected individuals **without undue delay**.

**NIS2** requires **essential** and **important** entities to report significant incidents:

- **Early warning:** Within **24 hours** of becoming aware (preliminary notification)
- **Detailed notification:** Within **72 hours** (incident details, impact, measures taken)
- **Final report:** Within **1 month** after containment (root cause, final impact, remediation)

**Key differences:**

- GDPR focuses on **personal data** impact
- NIS2 focuses on **service continuity** and **network/information system security**
- You may need to notify under **both** if an incident affects personal data *and* qualifies as a significant NIS2 incident

**Our advice:** Have a **decision tree** ready that maps incident scenarios to notification obligations. We help you build and test these playbooks *before* an incident hits.
