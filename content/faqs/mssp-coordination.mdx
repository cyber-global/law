question: Can you work with our MSSP?
order: 3

**Yesâ€”and we strongly recommend it.**

Effective incident response requires **legal + technical coordination**. Your MSSP handles threat containment, forensics, and remediation; we handle notifications, regulator liaison, and attorney-client privilege protection.

**How we coordinate:**

1. **Joint kickoff:** We establish roles, communication channels (Slack, Teams, Signal), and escalation paths
2. **Shared timeline:** One incident timeline that both technical and legal teams update in real-time
3. **Parallel workstreams:**
   - MSSP: Containment, forensics, root cause, remediation
   - Legal: Notification strategy, regulator engagement, communications drafting
4. **Unified reporting:** We combine technical findings and legal analysis into regulator-ready reports

**Attorney-client privilege:**

When we coordinate with your MSSP under legal engagement, we can extend **attorney work product protection** to technical findings, which may shield them from regulatory or litigation discovery.

**Partner network:**

If you don't have an MSSP or need additional forensic support, we can introduce you to vetted partners we've worked with on similar incidents.

**Bottom line:** Your MSSP and our legal team should be on the same call within the first hour of an incident. We make that coordination seamless.
