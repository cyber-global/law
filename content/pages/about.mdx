# About CyberGlobal Law

## Mission & Values

CyberGlobal Law is a boutique cyber law practice focused on **clarity, speed, and defensibility**. We help organizations navigate the intersection of cybersecurity and law—where technical incidents become legal, regulatory, and business challenges.

We believe that effective cyber law counsel should be:

- **Calm under pressure:** Incidents are chaotic. We bring structure and clear options.
- **Practical:** Our advice works in the real world, not just in theory.
- **Defensible:** We document decisions and processes to withstand regulatory and legal scrutiny.
- **Collaborative:** We work alongside your technical, compliance, and business teams—and with your existing counsel when needed.

## Who We Serve

We work with organizations across sectors that face complex cyber-legal challenges:

- **SaaS & Technology:** Data-intensive startups and scale-ups navigating GDPR, cross-border data flows, and customer contracts
- **Fintech & Financial Services:** Banks, payment processors, and fintech facing DORA, PSD2, and NIS2 compliance
- **Healthcare & Life Sciences:** Hospitals, research institutions, and health tech managing sensitive personal data and critical systems
- **Critical Infrastructure:** Energy, transport, and industrial operators subject to NIS2 and sector-specific security rules
- **Insurers & Brokers:** Cyber insurance carriers and brokers coordinating panel counsel and claims support

## Jurisdictions & Languages

**Primary focus:** European Union (all 27 member states), with particular expertise in Romania, Germany, France, and the Netherlands.

**Cross-border work:** We regularly coordinate with counsel in the UK, US, and Switzerland for multi-jurisdictional incidents and contracts.

**Languages:** English, Romanian, French

## Our Approach

### Playbooks, Not Just Advice

We don't just tell you what the law requires—we provide **structured playbooks** and **decision trees** so your teams know exactly what to do when an incident hits or a regulator asks questions.

### Artefacts, Not Just Opinions

Compliance and incident response require documentation. We deliver **audit-ready artefacts**:

- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs)
- Records of Processing Activities (RoPAs)
- Incident response timelines and notification logs
- Forensic chain-of-custody documentation

### Communication Cadence

Incidents move fast. We set up **structured check-ins** (often daily during active incidents) and use your preferred communication channels (Slack, Teams, Signal) to stay in sync.

## Team

Our team combines legal expertise with technical literacy. We understand security controls, forensic processes, and incident response workflows—not just the legal requirements around them.

## Why "CyberGlobal"?

Cyber incidents don't respect borders. A ransomware attack on a SaaS company in Romania can trigger GDPR notifications in Germany, NIS2 reporting in France, contractual disputes with a US cloud provider, and insurance claims in the UK.

We're "CyberGlobal" because we help you manage the **global legal ripple effects** of local cyber incidents.
