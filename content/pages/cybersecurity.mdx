# Cybersecurity & EU Regulations

## Why Legal + Technical Must Work Together

Cybersecurity is no longer purely a technical discipline. EU regulations now tie security controls to legal obligations, reporting timelines, and governance frameworks. Effective cyber resilience requires **one team with two specialties**: legal counsel and technical responders working from a shared playbook.

---

## EU Cyber Regulations: Plain-English Overview

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

**What it does:**  
Protects personal data of EU residents. Requires security measures, breach notification (72 hours to DPAs for certain breaches), and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing.

**Who it applies to:**  
Any organization processing EU residents' personal dataâ€”regardless of where the organization is based.

**Key legal-technical intersection:**  
- Security controls (encryption, access controls) are **legal requirements** under Article 32
- Breach detection and notification timelines require **coordinated IR processes**
- Data subject rights (access, erasure) need **technical implementation**

---

### NIS2 (Network and Information Security Directive 2)

**What it does:**  
Raises cybersecurity and incident reporting requirements for **essential** and **important** entities in critical sectors (energy, transport, finance, health, digital infrastructure, etc.). Introduces board accountability and supply chain security obligations.

**Who it applies to:**  
Medium and large organizations in designated sectors, based on size, sector, and criticality. Member states are transposing NIS2 into national law (deadline: October 2024).

**Key legal-technical intersection:**  
- **Incident reporting:** 24-hour early warning, 72-hour detailed notification, final report
- **Supply chain security:** Legal contracts + technical vendor risk assessments
- **Governance:** Board-level oversight of cyber risk (legal + technical briefings)

---

### DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)

**What it does:**  
Targets **financial entities** (banks, insurers, investment firms, crypto firms) with detailed ICT risk management, third-party risk, incident reporting, and resilience testing requirements.

**Who it applies to:**  
Financial institutions and their critical ICT service providers (cloud, data centers, managed security).

**Key legal-technical intersection:**  
- **ICT risk management:** Mapping security controls to DORA's requirements
- **Third-party risk:** Legal contracts (exit plans, audit rights) + technical criticality assessments
- **Testing:** Threat-led penetration testing (TLPT) with legal oversight of findings and remediation

---

### eIDAS2 (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services)

**What it does:**  
Updates trust services (e-signatures, seals, time stamps, certificates) and introduces a framework for **digital identity wallets** across the EU.

**Who it applies to:**  
Trust service providers (TSPs), organizations relying on qualified electronic signatures, and eventually, users of EU Digital Identity Wallets.

**Key legal-technical intersection:**  
- **Trust services security:** Legal licensing + technical security audits
- **Digital wallets:** Privacy (GDPR), security (technical architecture), and cross-border recognition (legal framework)

## How Legal + MSSP Work Together

### The Shared Playbook

Effective incident response and compliance require **joint ownership** of:

1. **Incident response runbooks:** Who does what, when, and who decides if it's reportable
2. **Log retention policies:** Legal hold requirements + technical retention capabilities
3. **Escalation matrices:** When to call legal, when to call MSSP, when to call the board
4. **Reporting timelines:** GDPR 72-hour, NIS2 24/72-hour, DORA 24/72-hour clocks
5. **Communications:** Who drafts notifications (legal) vs. technical incident summaries (MSSP)

### Division of Responsibilities

**Legal Counsel Responsibilities:**
- Notification strategy
- Regulator liaison  
- Drafting notices & Q&As
- Attorney-client privilege protection
- Contractual liability analysis

**MSSP/Technical Team Responsibilities:**
- Threat containment & eradication
- Forensic analysis & root cause
- Log collection & evidence preservation
- Technical remediation & patching
- Vendor coordination (EDR, SIEM, etc.)

### Joint Offering: One Team, Two Specialties

Many of our clients work with **Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)** for 24/7 monitoring, detection, and response. We coordinate with these partners to provide a **seamless legal + technical response**:

- **Legal privilege:** Our engagement protects analysis and decision-making from discovery
- **Technical execution:** MSSPs execute containment, forensics, and remediation under legal oversight
- **Unified timeline:** One shared incident timeline for both technical and legal reporting
