# Our Services

CyberLegal provides end-to-end cyber law counsel across the incident lifecycleâ€”from proactive compliance and vendor contracts to 24/7 breach response, forensics, and regulatory defense.

## Service Areas

We organize our services around the five most critical cyber-legal challenges organizations face:

1. **[Incident Response & Breach Counsel (24/7)](/services#incident-response)**  
   Rapid legal triage, notification strategy, regulator liaison, and post-incident remediation.

2. **[Regulatory Compliance & Audits](/services#compliance)**  
   Gap assessments, DPIAs, RoPAs, NIS2/DORA readiness, and audit preparation.

3. **[Contracts & Vendor/Cross-Border Data Risk](/services#contracts)**  
   DPAs, SCCs, SaaS terms, supply chain security, and transfer impact assessments.

4. **[Digital Forensics & eDiscovery](/services#forensics)**  
   Legally defensible evidence preservation, chain-of-custody, and expert reports.

5. **[Cyber Disputes, Enforcement & Insurance Recovery](/services#disputes)**
