# Our Partners

Effective cyber incident response and compliance require a **coordinated network** of legal, technical, and insurance expertise. We partner with leading Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), digital forensics firms, and cyber insurers to provide seamless, multi-disciplinary support.

## Why We Partner

Cyber incidents don't respect organizational silos. When an incident hits, you need:

- **Legal counsel** to manage notifications, regulator liaison, and privilege
- **Technical responders** to contain threats, preserve evidence, and restore systems
- **Forensic experts** to analyze artifacts and reconstruct timelines
- **Insurance coordination** to manage claims, coverage disputes, and panel counsel

Rather than forcing you to coordinate multiple vendors, we've built trusted relationships with vetted partners so you get **one team, multiple specialties**.

## Partner Criteria

We select partners based on:

- **Technical excellence:** Proven capabilities and certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2, industry-specific accreditations)
- **Regional coverage:** EU presence with cross-border capabilities
- **Communication:** Ability to translate technical findings into business and legal language
- **Independence:** No hidden conflicts or sales incentivesâ€”we recommend what's best for the client
- **Transparent pricing:** No surprise fees or scope creep
