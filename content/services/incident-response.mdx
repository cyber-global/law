## When a Breach Hits, Every Hour Counts

A cyber incident triggers a cascade of legal, regulatory, and business decisionsâ€”often under extreme time pressure. Our 24/7 breach counsel service provides immediate legal triage to help you stabilize facts, control disclosure, and meet notification deadlines without over-notifying or under-reporting.

## What You Get

### Immediate Response
- **24/7 availability:** Direct line to experienced breach counsel, not a call center
- **Privileged engagement:** Attorney-client privilege protects your investigation from discovery
- **Rapid assessment:** Is this a GDPR breach? NIS2 incident? Both? We help you classify and scope

### Notification Strategy
- **Timeline management:** GDPR's 72-hour clock, NIS2's 24/72-hour reporting, sector-specific rules
- **Multi-jurisdiction coordination:** Cross-border incidents with DPAs, CSIRTs, and national authorities
- **Stakeholder communications:** Drafting for data subjects, customers, partners, insurers, and the board

### Regulator & Law Enforcement Liaison
- **Authority engagement:** Managing inquiries from DPAs, CSIRTs, national cyber agencies
- **Investigation defense:** Representing your interests in regulatory proceedings
- **Remediation commitments:** Negotiating undertakings and remediation plans

### Post-Incident Documentation
- **Lessons learned:** Structured debrief with technical and legal teams
- **Policy updates:** Revising incident response plans, notification procedures, vendor contracts
- **Audit readiness:** Creating a defensible record for future regulatory or insurance reviews

## Outcomes

With rapid, privileged legal guidance, you achieve:

- **Shorter downtime:** Faster decisions mean quicker recovery
- **Reduced penalties:** Proper notification and cooperation often result in lower fines
- **Defensible record:** A clear timeline and documented decision-making process for audits and litigation
- **Preserved relationships:** Transparent, calm communications maintain trust with customers and partners

## Who This Is For

- CISOs and security teams dealing with active incidents
- General Counsel needing external breach counsel on standby
- Organizations in regulated sectors (finance, healthcare, critical infrastructure)

- Insurers and brokers coordinating panel counsel for policyholders
