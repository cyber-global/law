## Contracts That Work in the Real World

Vendor contracts are where compliance meets commercial reality. A poorly drafted Data Processing Agreement (DPA) or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) can derail a deal, fail an audit, or create hidden liability. You need contracts that satisfy regulators, auditors, and your technical teamsâ€”without killing the deal.

We draft and negotiate vendor agreements that balance legal defensibility with operational feasibility.

## What You Get

### Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
- **Controller-Processor DPAs:** GDPR Article 28 compliant, clear scope and instructions
- **Technical and Organizational Measures (TOMs):** Annex II that your engineers can actually implement
- **Sub-processor management:** Approval processes, lists, and change notifications
- **Audit rights:** Balanced clauses that work for both sides (not "full access at any time")

### Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- **Module selection:** Which SCC modules (C2C, C2P, P2P, P2C) apply to your flow?
- **Annexes:** Data categories, processing purposes, technical measures, competent authorities
- **Supplementary measures:** When are SCCs alone insufficient? TIAs and additional safeguards
- **Multi-party scenarios:** Docking clauses, joint controllers, sub-processors

### Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs)
- **Schrems II compliance:** Assessing third-country laws, government access, and effective remedies
- **Supplementary measures:** Encryption, pseudonymization, data minimization
- **Documentation:** Audit-ready TIA reports for DPAs and customers

### Cloud & SaaS Agreements
- **Shared responsibility models:** Clear delineation of security duties
- **Logging & monitoring:** Retention, access, and format for forensic investigations
- **Breach notification:** Timing, content, and escalation procedures
- **Data portability & deletion:** Practical timelines and formats
- **Jurisdiction & data residency:** Where data is stored, processed, and backed up

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- **Security SLAs:** Uptime, patch timelines, incident response SLAs
- **Remedies aligned to risk:** Credits, termination rights, and liability caps
- **Measurement & reporting:** KPIs, metrics, and dashboards

### Supply Chain & Pass-Through Obligations
- **NIS2/DORA supply chain clauses:** Security requirements, incident notification, audit rights
- **Vendor risk tiering:** Criticality assessments and risk-based controls
- **Exit planning:** Data extraction, transition assistance, and deletion verification

## Outcomes

With clear, enforceable vendor contracts, you achieve:

- **Faster deals:** Pre-negotiated DPAs and SCCs accelerate procurement
- **Fewer renegotiations:** Regulator-proof clauses that stand up to audits and legal review
- **Audit-proof vendor stack:** Documentation that satisfies DPAs, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIS2
- **Reduced liability:** Clear allocation of risk and remediation obligations

## Who This Is For

- Procurement and legal teams negotiating SaaS, cloud, and vendor contracts
- CISOs managing third-party security risk
- Data Protection Officers ensuring GDPR Article 28 compliance
- Organizations with complex, multi-vendor stacks
- Companies transferring data outside the EU
