## When Evidence Matters, Process Is Everything

In cyber incidents, investigations, and disputes, digital evidence is often the most critical—and most fragile—asset. Mishandled forensics or eDiscovery can render evidence inadmissible, create spoliation claims, or blow investigation budgets. You need legally defensible processes from day one.

We provide legal oversight and documentation to ensure your forensic and eDiscovery workflows stand up in court, regulatory proceedings, and audits.

- **Documentation:** Audit trail of hold notices, acknowledgments, and reminders
- **Defensibility:** Protecting against spoliation claims and sanctions

### Forensic Collection & Chain of Custody
- **Collection scope:** Endpoints, servers, cloud accounts, logs, backups—what's relevant?
- **Vendor oversight:** Managing forensic consultants, ensuring proper methodology
- **Chain-of-custody tracking:** Who touched what, when, and where
