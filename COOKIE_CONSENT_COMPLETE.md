# Cookie Consent & Analytics - Complete Implementation

## ✅ First-Party Cookie Banner with Analytics Blocking

All cookie consent features implemented per BRIEF specifications.

**Status:** Analytics is blocked by default, only enabled after explicit consent ✅

---

## Complete Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **CookieBanner** (`components/cookie-banner.tsx`) ✅
2. **AnalyticsProvider** (`components/analytics-provider.tsx`) ✅
3. **Analytics Utilities** (`lib/analytics.ts`) ✅
4. **Root Layout** (`app/layout.tsx`) - Uses AnalyticsProvider ✅

---

## How It Works

### User Journey:
```
1. User visits site (no prior consent)
   → Analytics BLOCKED
   → Cookie banner shows after 1 second

2. User clicks "Accept All"
   → Consent stored in localStorage
   → Event dispatched
   → AnalyticsProvider re-renders
   → Vercel Analytics loads
   → Tracking ENABLED

3. User clicks "Necessary Only"
   → Consent stored (analytics: false)
   → Analytics remains BLOCKED
   → Only essential cookies used

4. Return visit
   → Consent read from localStorage
   → Banner doesn't show
   → Analytics loads if previously consented
```

## Consent Storage

**Method:** localStorage (first-party only)

**Value:**
```json
{
  "necessary": true,
  "analytics": true|false,

}
```

**Benefits of localStorage:**

- Persists across sessions
- Easy to read/write
- No server-side needed
- Privacy-friendly
